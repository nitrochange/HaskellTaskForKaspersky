# ðŸŽ’ðŸ““ðŸ’» Task 2

**NOTE: If you just fork this repository it will not be graded. Ask your supervisor for a special GitHub classroom URL.**

## How to do the task

Your task is to write a valid definition for every function declared in `src/Task.hs`. All functions have a comment describing what the function needs to do with some examples.

There are predefined tests for you to check your answer. You can look at the tests for some more usage examples in `test/Tests.hs`.

After defining all functions you then need to commit **and push** your code to your repository. An automated script will then check your solution and give you feedback as a CI result in your GitHub repository.

## FAQ

> Can I add extra functions in the `Task.hs` file?

Yes, you can, but you can not remove existing functions.
